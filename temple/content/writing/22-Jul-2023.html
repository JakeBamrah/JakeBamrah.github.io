        <h2 class="writing-header">Rebuilding this website again...</h2>
        <p>
            The original intention of this website was to document what I've
            been working on. I do this not for others, but purely for myself,
            as a means of summarising what I've learned and to reflect on the
            outcome of my work / life / whatever really, as it unfolds. It's
            also a useful way to hold myself accountable for the ideas that
            I've started. The (big) caveat here is that articulating your
            thoughts out in the open can be intimidating, even if I end up being
            the only one reading them. It provokes a sense of vulnerability and
            I'm not sure why. It's probably of no surprise to any of us then,
            that the initial intentions of this project have not yet been
            realised, and it's ended up serving as another form of
            procrastination rather than a means for expressing myself...
        </p>

            Anyways, this is the third re-write of this thing‚Äîeach time a little
            more pared back than the attempt before it‚Äîthe first iteration used
            react and typescript to provide a whole load of unnecessary features
            (self-served fonts, copious amounts of css and questionable design).
            As you can imagine, this attempt was bloated, completely
            over-engineered and honestly, not an accurate reflection of myself
            (hindsight can be cruel üòÇ). The
            <a href="https://old.bamrah.sh/">second attempt</a> was a complete
            re-write of the original functionality using web-components (Svelte)
            and Tailwind‚Äîcustom fonts now removed, brotli
            compression instead of gzip‚Äîthe weight-loss was in full-swing. It
            was by this point that I was becoming increasingly aware of the
            performance (or lack of) in modern software and so, with this
            attempt I managed to trim 90% from the website's original footprint
            (400KB ‚Üí 35KB compressed). For a simple text portfolio, I would
            still call this bloated, but on reflection, I learned quite a lot
            about the Typescript and Svelte ecosystem by using them in a
            (simple) production environment along with maintenance and
            improvements, if there were any. Svelte was such a positive
            experience in fact, that I went on to build a much larger project¬π,
            something I didn't end up deploying but learned a lot from.
        </p>
        <p>
            We're now ~2 years after inception (and with very little written),
            I have just spent 1-2 days throwing together this iteration after
            work. New experiences since my last attempt have materialised as a
            change in perspective and my priorities have shifted. I feel more
            strongly about simplicity than ever before (both in work and life)
            and I continue to whittle away at performance oriented design in my
            projects. I have gone back to basics with this attempt, pure HTML,
            sparing use of CSS¬≤ and most notably, <i>no javascript</i>. The aim
            was to improve <i>time-to-first-byte</i> by keeping each page well
            below 14KB (~2-3KB raw) and embedding the HTML and CSS into a single
            file (this avoids chunked transfer-encoding and ensures that the
            entire page is delivered in the first packet of HTML)¬≥.
        </p>
        <p>
            What stood out to me most here, is that you quickly realise just how
            much work these frameworks do for you and with my goal of keeping
            each file to a single page, I found HTML duplication to be a
            problem. In order to avoid this (repeating the same CSS and headers
            per page), I decided to throw together a quick and dirty HTML
            template-engine, aptly named <i>Temple</i>‚Å¥. This was an attempt to
            build a proof-of-concept that implemented the absolute
            <i>minimum</i> templating syntax required to get this project up and
            running. A quick look at the code will reveal that I have committed
            the cardinal sin of template-engines, <i>parsing HTML using regular
            expressions</i> (forgive me! üôèüèº), however, I have a lofty goal to
            re-write this project using tokens and a simple lexer ;). I find
            coming up with new ideas quite difficult, and what I've liked about
            this project is that it all kind of happened organically. I'm
            excited to explore lexers and I'm excited to write some meaningful C
            | Rust. Wrapping it all up, I'm quite happy with the outcome and I
            learned more than I anticipated. I no longer have an excuse to avoid
            dumping my thoughts onto the internet, and the messages will get
            delivered a little bit quicker than before, whether that's a good or
            bad thing remains to be seen...
